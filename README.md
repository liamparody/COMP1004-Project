# COMP1004-Project
Project GitHub for COMP1004 - Liam Parody.
Welcome to the Github page for my database project
,this database is for Bayside School, you can view, add, edit and delete records,
use the grade calculator to calculate grades and save them directly 
to a students record.
use the help page for more info! Make sure to download all the files from this 
github and run the index.html file, you can then use the BaysideTest.json file
to test the database, or make a new record and then save that json file instead.
